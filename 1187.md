1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing
====================================

Description
-----------

Given `arr1` and `arr2`, return min. number of operations
it takes to make `arr1` strictly increasing

- An operation is `arr1[i] = arr2[j]`
- If impossible, return `-1`

Brainstorm
----------

### Simplified Version ###

To start, let's assume `arr2` contains all integers.

Going through `arr1`. Upon finding a misplaced number,
swap it with a number that increments the previous by 1.


#### Optimization ####

Considering `arr1` is completely random, there is no way to save
time by not looking at some elements.

### Original Problem ###

Now, `arr2` has only a limited selection of integers.

We can do the same, finding the next integer that follows. To find
the successor, **sorting `arr2` should help**

What if something like `arr1:5 2 3 4 5; arr2:1;` happens?

`arr1[i]` is static if the previous elements cannot be swapped with
`arr2`
